# Sonic-Riders-DX-Online
An online version Sonic Riders DX to be played off the web from your browser.

A good start would be the have to first have the games files uploaded here to the repo and continue on from there. That along with implementing the Dolphin emu
(https://github.com/BlueSwordM/Riders-Dolphin-EX). The emulator would runnning in the background for the game to load up in the browser.
